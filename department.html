                has since in 2007 been training students in Higher 
                National Diploma programme. The Department trains
                students in various fields of computing that equips
                them with knowledge for development and utilization
                of modern computing. Graduates are placed in work 
                positions that are in high demand in the society.

                the programme is to produce competent
                graduates with the requisite knowledge 
                in the basic and applied sciences needed 
                to process and preserve food with the view 
                of ensuring food security, value addition,
                and economic growth of the country.
                To be internationally recognized as a Centre
                for training people for the agro business and
                Hospitality and Tourism industries for 
                effective job performance.

                <span class="all-dept">Department Of Mathematical Science</span> <br><br> The department has always 
                maintained an old philosophy that “If you can’t count or 
                measure it, you can’t manage it” therefore our activities
                affect all policies, and touch all aspects of people’s 
                lives. The Department of Mathematical Sciences came into 
                existence after a reorganization exercise in 2011. 
                Currently plans are far advanced to split the Department 
                into two namely; Department of Mathematical Sciences and 
                Department of Statistical Sciences.The Department services
                all other Departments including parallel and evening 
                programmes in the University.
